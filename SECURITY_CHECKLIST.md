### 🚨 Critical Security Actions Required

#### 1. **IMMEDIATE: Rotate Firebase API Keys**
- [ ] Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- [ ] Navigate to Project Settings > General
- [ ] Regenerate the Web API Key
- [ ] Update your `.env.local` file with the new key
- [ ] Deploy the updated configuration

#### 2. **IMMEDIATE: Update Environment Variables**
- [ ] Create a new `.env.local` file from `env.local.example`
- [ ] Add your actual Firebase credentials to `.env.local`
- [ ] Ensure `.env.local` is NOT committed to version control
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables are set

#### 3. **Deploy Security Updates**
- [ ] Deploy updated Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Deploy updated Storage rules: `firebase deploy --only storage`
- [ ] Deploy updated hosting config: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### 🔒 Ongoing Security Practices

#### Environment Variables
- [ ] Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- [ ] Use placeholder values in example files
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly (every 90 days)
- [ ] Use different keys for development/staging/production
- [ ] **NEW**: Regularly audit all files for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] **NEW**: Use environment variable validation in CI/CD pipelines

#### Firebase Rules
- [ ] Review Firestore rules monthly
- [ ] Test rules with Firebase Emulator Suite
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Security Rules usage
- [ ] Implement least-privilege access
- [ ] **NEW**: Test rules with different user roles and permissions

#### Code Security
- [ ] Regular security audits of authentication logic
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] **NEW**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- [ ] **NEW**: Code review for security best practices

### 🧪 Testing Security Rules

```bash
# Test Firestore rules locally
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Test Storage rules locally
firebase emulators:start --only storage

# Test hosting configuration
firebase emulators:start --only hosting
```

### 📊 Security Monitoring

- [ ] Enable Firebase Security Rules usage monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Monitor database access patterns
- [ ] Regular security log reviews

### 🆘 Emergency Response

If credentials are compromised:
1. **IMMEDIATELY** rotate all Firebase API keys
2. Review Firebase Console logs for unauthorized access
3. Check Firestore and Storage access logs
4. Update all environment variables
5. Redeploy with new credentials
6. Monitor for suspicious activity
